## Plot the data of an individual


This part of the repo stored all of the file that are needed for the following steps. Please refer to [this notebook](prs_graph.ipynb) for the details of each step. 

9. **Integrate 23andMe Data**: Incorporate individual genotype data into the PRS pipeline and compare results with population-level PRS distributions.
10. **Annotate Functional Variants**: Cross-reference cis-eQTL results with functional annotation datasets (e.g., ATAC-seq) to identify biologically relevant variants.

11. **Interpret Results**: Summarize findings through statistical analysis, visualizations, and population-level comparisons for traits like height, asthma, and ankylosing spondylitis.
