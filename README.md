# dsc180_prs_project
A repo used for dsc180 capstone project.

## Introduction
Our capstone is lead by professor Tiffany Amariuta. Please refer to the [website](https://tiffanyamariuta.github.io/capstone-genetic-risk-prediction/) for the further details.



## Environment
Please refer to this [yml file](https://github.com/Elijahzyp/dsc180_prs_project/blob/main/environment.yml) to get the details of our project dependencies. 

## Data
Our datasets are too big for GitHub. So we uploaded all the datasets to Google Drive and here are links to the datasets.
